# Questions on basic Recursion

All the basic questions/answers on recursion are here.

## Q.1 Calculate sum of digits recursively.

Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the digits of a positive number.

```bash
Input  : 435
Output : 12 # 4 + 3 + 5 = 12

Input  : 99
Output : 18 # 9 + 9 = 18
```

## Q.2 Calculate power of number recursively.

Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number.

```bash
Input  : n = 3, m = 3
Output : 27 # 3 * 3 * 3 = 27

Input  : n = 2, m = 4
Output : 16 # 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
```
