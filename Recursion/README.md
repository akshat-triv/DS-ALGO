# Questions on basic Recursion

All the basic questions/answers on recursion are here.

## Q.1 Calculate sum of digits recursively.

Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of the digits of a positive number.

```bash
Input  : 435
Output : 12 # 4 + 3 + 5 = 12

Input  : 99
Output : 18 # 9 + 9 = 18
```

## Q.2 Calculate power of number recursively.

Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number.

```bash
Input  : n = 3, m = 3
Output : 27 # 3 * 3 * 3 = 27

Input  : n = 2, m = 4
Output : 16 # 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
```

## Q.3 Find GCD recursively.

Write a program find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers recursively.

```bash
Input  : num1 = 8, num2 = 12
Output : 4 #GCD(48, 18) = 2

Input  : num1 = 48, num2 = 18
Output : 2 #GCD(48, 18) = 2
```
