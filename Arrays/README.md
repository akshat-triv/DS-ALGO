# Questions on arrays

All the questions/answers on arrays are here.

## Q.1 Write a program to reverse an array or string

Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.

```bash
Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output : arr[] = {3, 2, 1}

Input :  arr[] = {4, 5, 1, 2}
Output : arr[] = {2, 1, 5, 4}
```

## Q.2 Write a function to return minimum and maximum in an array.

Your program should make the minimum number of comparisons.

```bash
Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output : obj{} = {min: 1, max: 9}

Input :  arr[] = {34, 25, 111, 421, 619, 502, 166, 15, 420}
Output : obj[] = {min: 15, max: 619}
```

## Q.3 Resort the array in O(n) complexity.

You are given a sorted array containing both negative and positive values. Resort the array taking absolute value of negative numbers. Your complexity should be O(n).

```bash
Input  : arr[] = {-8, -5, -3, -1, 3, 6, 9}
Output : arr[] = {-1, -3, 3, -5, 6, -8, 9}
```

## Q.4 K’th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array

Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than the size of the array, we need to find the k’th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

```bash
Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}
k = 3
Output: 7

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}
k = 4
Output: 10
```

## Q.5 Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

```bash
Input: arr[] = {0, 2, 1, 2, 0}
Output: arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 2, 2}

Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 0}
Output: arr[] = {0, 0, 1}
```
